# celebrateWithMethods
Created with CodeSandbox

I created some additional properties, including two new methods. I used conditional statements to change the body, text, and reveal a gif to celebrate meeting or surpassing my studying goals.

I also did the following in this repo:
- created new properties
- added values and created a conditional statement
- added a method to celebrate
- used call methods
